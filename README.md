# Hngman-using-python
Hangman is a word-guessing game where the computer selects a random word, and the player attempts to discover the word by suggesting letters. The game provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses, and the player aims to guess the entire word before running out of allowed incorrect attempts.

let us start with a brief description about the project of hangman using python 
The Hangman game implemented in Python is a text-based interactive game where the player tries to guess a hidden word letter by letter
Game Overview: 

Hangman is a word-guessing game where the computer selects a random word, and the player attempts to discover the word by suggesting letters. The game provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses, and the player aims to guess the entire word before running out of allowed incorrect attempts.

Key components:

Word Selection:

The game starts by choosing a random word from a predefined list.
Displaying the Word:

The chosen word is initially displayed as underscores, representing each letter in the word.
User Interaction:

The player inputs a letter guess.
The game checks if the letter is in the chosen word.
Feedback:

Correct Guess:
If the guessed letter is in the word, it replaces the corresponding underscores.
The player is informed of a correct guess, and the guessed letters are displayed.
Incorrect Guess:
If the guessed letter is not in the word, the player is notified of an incorrect guess.
The game keeps track of the number of incorrect attempts.
Winning and Losing:

The player wins by successfully guessing the entire word before reaching the maximum allowed incorrect attempts.
The player loses if the maximum allowed incorrect attempts are reached without guessing the word.
Game Loop:

The game continues in a loop until the player either wins or loses.
The player can make additional guesses until the game concludes.
User Input Validation:

The game ensures that the player enters a valid input (a single alphabetical letter) and provides appropriate feedback for invalid inputs.
Interactivity:

The game prompts the player for input and dynamically updates the display to show the progress and feedback.
Programming Concepts:

The code involves concepts such as functions, loops, conditional statements, and string manipulation.
Educational Value:

The Hangman game is often used as a simple programming exercise for beginners to practice basic Python programming concepts and logic. It provides a fun and interactive way to learn and apply coding skills
